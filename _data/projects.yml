- name: Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality for Smart Health
  descr1: "• Improved an existing 3D cardiac myocyte model by using Blender with (1) myocyte view including ion channels, and select organelles, (2) membrane level view presenting the electrophysiology of a cardiac cell for users."
  descr2: "• Combined 3D model with Unreal Engine (C++ and Blueprint Visual Scripting system) to build VR user interface for visualizing voltage, ion movement and action potential."
  descr3: "• Implemented a user interface and some functions to gather raw data for analyzing the behavior of users to (1) improve user interaction with VR models, (2) promote self-regulated learning."

- name: Uni.Share – A Decentralized C2C Platform
  descr1: "• A decentralized C2C APP self-driven by the university students community, where motivation comes from a true heart of love and a reward system consists of virtual currency and virtual stock."
  descr2: "• Came up with the idea of a reasonable reward system consisting of virtual currency and virtual stock shares to motivate students to post information."
  descr3: "• Collaborated with team members to complete the high-fidelity prototype with part of backend functions and presented a demo to sponsor companies within a limited 24-hour timeframe.             "

- name: Logistic Regression Cat Recognizer
  descr1: "• Implemented a logistic regression classifier model, preprocessed the different types of images in the database, and trained the model to predict input images with output label cat or non-cat with 87.34% accuracy."
  descr2: "• Revising the model to shallow Neural Networks to improve the prediction accuracy and potentially add more layers to the model in the future."

- name: Blockchain mock-up
  descr1: "• Implemented a simple mock-up of a Blockchain Server-Client node using JavaScript that could do some basic operations like mine, new-transaction, and view of chain on localhost."
  descr2: "• Building the User Interface for the user to play with the Blockchain mock-up application to get a visualization understanding of the Blockchain.                       "
